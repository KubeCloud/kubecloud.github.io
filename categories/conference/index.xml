Crazy walk-up line before the first session of the day with Sam Newman on Building Microservices on AWS. Luckily I got up early and queued up 70 minutes before the talk. At this point, 20–30 people were already lined up. But I managed to get in.</description></item><item><title>AWS re:invent 2017 — Day 1</title><link>https://kubecloud.github.io/website/posts/2017-11-28_aws-re-invent-2017-day-1-c4cdb5955dfc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2017 03:50:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubecloud.github.io/website/posts/2017-11-28_aws-re-invent-2017-day-1-c4cdb5955dfc/</guid><description>The focus of my first day at Reinvent was mostly on the topic of security and financial services. Re:invent is very crowded and there’s crazy lines for some of the sessions. Note to self: If you don’t have a reserved seat — come early (like really early). In the following I will give a short write up of the breakout sessions that I attended.</description></item><item><title>AWS re:invent 2017 — Day 0</title><link>https://kubecloud.github.io/website/posts/2017-11-27_aws-re-invent-2017-day-0-e91baef32d54/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 06:18:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubecloud.github.io/website/posts/2017-11-27_aws-re-invent-2017-day-0-e91baef32d54/</guid><description>Welcome to Las Vegas
Our first full day in Las Vegas is over. It’s been a great day with time to explore the city and be a tourist before kicking off the AWS re:invent conference tomorrow.
Re:invent is going to be big. 40k-45k attendees. I’m guessing over 3/4 of the passengers of yesterdays flight from Stockholm to Las Vegas were attendees flying in.</description></item><item><title>CloudNativeCon + KubeCon Europe 2017</title><link>https://kubecloud.github.io/website/posts/2017-04-02_cloudnativecon-kubecon-europe-2017-12c37c3af38c/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2017 09:47:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubecloud.github.io/website/posts/2017-04-02_cloudnativecon-kubecon-europe-2017-12c37c3af38c/</guid><description>CloudNativeCon + KubeCon Europe 2017 is over!
