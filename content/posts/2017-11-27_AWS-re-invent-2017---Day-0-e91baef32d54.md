Welcome to Las Vegas

Our first full day in Las Vegas is over. It’s been a great day with time to explore the city and be a tourist before kicking off the AWS re:invent conference tomorrow.

Re:invent is going to be big. 40k-45k attendees. I’m guessing over 3/4 of the passengers of yesterdays flight from Stockholm to Las Vegas were attendees flying in. I am really looking forward to this awesome conference.

As mentioned before, today was more about being a tourist, rather than an AWS re:invent attendee. We had pre-booked a helicopter tour over Grand Canyon — and what a great experience. It was my first time flying in a helicopter. We chose the “Golden Eagle Air Tour” from Papillon. The tour includes views of the Las Vegas Strip, Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, The Colorado River, and of course the Grand Canyon. And not to forget pick-up and drop-off by a stretch limo (we are in freaking Vegas).

Alright, enough with the tourist pictures. That’s not why we travelled to Las Vegas. We are here for AWS re:invent. After the helicopter ride, we picked up our conference badges at the MGM Grand, and we are now ready to start learning tomorrow.

… sorry for the “not so” technical, nor detailed post. Stay tuned for kickoff — and more details about AWS re:invent once it kicks off.
