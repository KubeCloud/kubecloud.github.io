It’s been a while since our last blog post. We have been crazy busy teaching a course about Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, etc., using a Kubernetes Raspberry Pi cluster, named KubeCloud.

During this course we have evaluated the use of KubeCloud and how it can help students understand these different concepts. We have a lot of material that we will be sharing after the defense of our thesis at June 20th.

But in the meantime, we have a little treat for you. We couldn’t help ourselves, and we had to build something special for our personal clusters.

**Kubernetes Logo Shaped Cluster**

We like the Kubernetes logo and thought it would be an awesome template for a cluster. See the images below:

**_What you need to build your own Kubernetes shaped cluster_**

*   4pc Raspberry Pi (We used the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)
*   4pc 16 GB MicroSDHC cards
*   1pc Small Switch (We used the d-link go-sw-5e)
*   4pc 0.3m Ethernet cables (we chose different colors for easy identification)
*   1pc USB Power Hub (We used Anker PowerPort 6 60W)
*   4pc Micro-USB cables 0.3m (approx 1ft)

The last thing you need is of course the rack it self. We had it custom made at a laser cutting company. An Illustrator template can be [downloaded here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kubecloud-public/kubecloud.ai).

Once your cluster is assembled, have a look at our previous guide on how to set up [Kubernetes-on-ARM](https://kubecloud.io/installing-a-kubernetes-1-4-cluster-on-hypriot-1-1-1-with-kubeadm-b7495638610e).

Stay tuned for more stuff about Kubernetes, Clusters, Raspberry Pis, Microservices, etc.
