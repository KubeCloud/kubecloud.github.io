Welcome to our blog about the work we are about to begin within the subject of resilient cloud computing.

The title of our project is as follows: **Resilient cloud computing in a controlled test environment**

And what does that involve? That is a really good question, and a question we will start a quest for the next five month to answer this. But for now, this title involves the following description:

> _The focus of the present master’s thesis is twofold: i) to build a Raspberry Pi cluster as a fully-controlled small-scale cloud computing environment; and ii) to conduct practical, comparative, and theoretical investigations into fault tolerance, resilience, load balancing, and virtualization in cloud computing. Moreover, the cluster should be able to provide visual and/or textual feedback of relevant computing status information. All of the above should be designed, implemented, tested, and documented in a suitable, clear, and concise manner._

So, we are going to look into 2 things, firstly how to build a Raspberry Pi cluster, and how can we build it so that its highly configurable. The idea is that our work is going to be embedded in an already existing course at Aarhus University School of Engineering, called Object-Oriented Network Communication. How can we build a cluster that works with fx. Kubernetes or Docker Swarm with 4 nodes? and how can this cluster be integrated with 7 identical clusters to form one big cluster without a lot of manual configuration?

Thats the initial quest of our journey. The second half is about designing a small scale model of a microservice setup. What does it mean to move your application into the world of modularized distributed systems, and how can you make it reliable? This involves testing out different solutions and design patterns, and investigating the overhead involved in the different ways of accomplishing the same thing.

So the title mentioned shopping tech! We have been so fortunate to get our hands on 32 Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and a lot cables, SD cards etc.

Lastly, to give you an impression of our idea of how the cluster is going to be designed physically, we created the following 3D model:

Have a great day, and stay tuned for more exciting Raspberry Pi cluster stuff!
